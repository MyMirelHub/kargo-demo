# Solution: Automated Deployment Pipeline using Argo, Kargo and Actions CI

## Objective

This solution aims to address common challenges in deployment automation, observability, and scalability by implementing a robust, automated deployment pipeline.

## Key Problems Addressed

1. **Slow and Manual Deployments:** Manual, script-based deployments are time-consuming and error-prone.
2. **Lack of Observability:** Difficulty in tracking deployment history and changes limits visibility.
3. **Scalability Issues:** Spreadsheet-based deployment tracking is inefficient and hinders growth.

## Solution Architecture

### Tools and Technologies

* **Version Control:** GitHub
* **CI:** GitHub Actions
* **CD:** Argo CD
* **Lifecycle Orchestration:** Kargo
* **Hosting Environment:** Kubernetes (local Kind cluster)

### Pipeline Steps

1. **Code Commit to GitHub:** Developers commit code changes to the GitHub repository.
2. **CI Trigger via GitHub Actions:**
   * **Build:** The CI pipeline builds the application and creates a container image.
   * **Push to Registry:** The built image is pushed to a container registry.
   * **Tag Creation:** Semantic versioning tags are automatically created based on commit messages, triggering deployments based on tag type.
3. **CD via Argo CD:**
   * **Automated Deployment:** Argo CD detects tagged builds and deploys them to the appropriate environment (test, UAT, or production) based on tag type and promotion policies.
   * **Observability and Tracking:** Argo CD provides a detailed history of deployments, environment statuses, and release details.
4. **Lifecycle Management with Kargo:**
   * **Staged Rollouts:** Kargo orchestrates the staged rollout process from test to UAT to production, adhering to defined policies.
   * **Manual Approvals and Verification:** Kargo can pause deployments between environments for manual approval or additional testing.

## Benefits to Methodolgy

* **Reduced Deployment Time:** Automated steps minimize manual intervention, accelerating release cycles.
* **Error Reduction:** Automated, policy-driven promotions and rollbacks reduce human error.
* **Improved Observability:** Argo CD offers a unified view of deployment history, environment status, and release timelines.
* **Enhanced Scalability:** Eliminates spreadsheet-based tracking, enabling efficient, automated workflows to support growth.

## Usage

### Prerequisites

* GitHub repository with GitHub Actions enabled
* Argo CD setup for CD to Kubernetes environments
* Kargo configured for lifecycle orchestration
* Kubernetes Cluster (local Kind or cloud-based)

### Steps to Run the Pipeline

1. Clone the GitHub repository with the CI/CD configuration.
2. Set up Argo CD and Kargo on your Kubernetes cluster.
3. Configure Kargo to manage promotion policies and add approvals between test, UAT, and production stages.
4. Commit code changes to GitHub, triggering GitHub Actions, Argo CD, and Kargo to automate the deployment process across environments.
